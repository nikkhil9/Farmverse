            <h3>Pineapples<span>Fruit Cultivation</span></h3>

            <p><b>Introduction:</b>
            Pineapples are a tropical fruit prized for their sweet and tangy flavor. They are not only delicious but also rich in vitamins, enzymes, and antioxidants, which are beneficial for health. Pineapples can be eaten fresh, juiced, or used in cooking.</p>

            <p><b>Choosing the Planting Site:</b>
            Day 1-7: Site and Soil Preparation</p>

            <p><b>Light Requirements:</b>
            Sunlight: Pineapples require full sun and should receive at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight each day. This is essential for healthy growth and fruit development.</p>

            <p><b>Soil Type:</b>
            pH Level: Pineapples prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH of 4.5-6.5.
            Amendments: They grow best in well-drained, sandy loam soil. Adding organic matter such as compost or well-rotted manure can improve soil structure and fertility, enhancing pineapple growth.</p>

            <p><b>Planting:</b>
            Day 8-14: Planting Pineapple Crowns or Slips</p>

            <p><b>Ideal Timing:</b>
            Season: Plant pineapples in the warm season when temperatures are consistently above 60°F (15°C). Pineapples are sensitive to cold and should be planted after the last frost.</p>

            <p><b>Planting Technique:</b>
            Depth: Plant the pineapple crown or slip deep enough to stabilize it, covering the lower leaves with soil. Space plants about 12-36 inches apart, allowing room for growth and air circulation.</p>

            <p><b>Watering:</b>
            After Planting: Water immediately after planting to help settle the soil around the roots. Pineapples prefer consistent moisture but are drought-tolerant once established. Avoid overwatering, as pineapples are susceptible to root rot.</p>

            <p><b>Care During Growth:</b>
            Week 2-12: Nurturing the Pineapple Plants</p>

            <p><b>Feeding:</b>
            Fertilization: Use a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10) every 6-8 weeks during the growing season to support growth and fruiting. Pineapples also benefit from additional magnesium, which can be supplied using Epsom salts.</p>

            <p><b>Mulching:</b>
            Technique: Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the pineapple plants to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and improve soil conditions. Keep mulch away from the plant's crown to prevent rot.</p>

            <p><b>Pest and Disease Management:</b>
            Routine: Monitor for pests such as mealybugs, mites, and nematodes. Use appropriate organic or chemical treatments as needed. Proper spacing and avoiding overhead watering can help prevent fungal diseases.</p>

            <p><b>Harvesting:</b>
            Timing: Pineapples are typically ready to harvest 18-24 months after planting when they have developed a uniform golden color and a sweet aroma. Cut the fruit with a sharp knife, leaving a short stem attached to the fruit.</p>

            <p><b>Pruning:</b>
            Care: Remove any dead or damaged leaves to maintain plant health. Pineapples do not require extensive pruning, but removing suckers (small shoots) can focus energy on fruit production.</p>

            <p><b>Watering:</b>
            Routine: Continue regular watering, especially during dry periods. Pineapples need a steady supply of water but do not tolerate waterlogged conditions, so ensure good drainage.</p>

            <p><b>Seasonal Transition:</b>
            Year-Round Care</p>

            <p><b>Preparing for Winter:</b>
            Technique: In colder climates, pineapples should be grown in pots and brought indoors or placed in a greenhouse during winter. They require a warm environment to thrive and are not frost-tolerant.</p>

            <p><b>Overwintering:</b>
            Method: In frost-free regions, pineapples can continue to grow year-round. Protect plants from extreme cold by covering them or moving them to a sheltered area.</p>

            <p><b>Planning for Next Season:</b>
            Technique: Pineapples will continue to produce for several years. After harvesting the main fruit, allow the plant to produce slips or suckers, which can be used to grow new plants.</p>
