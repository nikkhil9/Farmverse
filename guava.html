            <h3>Guava<span>Cultivation</span></h3>

            <p><b>Introduction:</b>
            Guavas are tropical fruits that are easy to grow and thrive in warm climates. Known for their high vitamin C content, guavas are a nutritious and delicious addition to any home garden.</p>

            <p><b>Choosing the Planting Site:</b>
            Day 1-7: Site and Soil Preparation</p>

            <p><b>Light Requirements:</b>
            Sunlight: Guava plants require full sun to thrive, which means at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight each day.</p>

            <p><b>Soil Type:</b>
            pH Level: Guavas prefer well-drained soil with a pH of 5.5-7.5.
            Amendments: Enrich the soil with organic compost to improve drainage and fertility. Guavas can tolerate a variety of soil types, including sandy, loamy, and even slightly clayey soils.</p>

            <p><b>Planting:</b>
            Day 8-14: Planting Guava Trees</p>

            <p><b>Ideal Timing:</b>
            Season: Plant guava trees in early spring or early summer when the soil temperature has warmed up.</p>

            <p><b>Planting Depth:</b>
            Technique: Dig a hole that is twice as wide and as deep as the root ball. Place the tree in the hole, ensuring that the top of the root ball is level with the soil surface. Backfill with soil and water thoroughly.</p>

            <p><b>Spacing:</b>
            Technique: If planting multiple trees, space them 10-15 feet apart to allow adequate room for growth.</p>

            <p><b>Watering:</b>
            After Planting: Water the tree thoroughly after planting. Continue to water regularly, especially during the first year as the tree establishes itself.</p>

            <p><b>Care During Growth:</b>
            Month 1-12: Nurturing the Guava Trees</p>

            <p><b>Feeding:</b>
            Fertilization: Apply a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10) three times a year—in spring, summer, and fall. For young trees, apply 1/4 pound of fertilizer, and increase the amount as the tree matures.</p>

            <p><b>Watering:</b>
            Consistency: Guava trees are relatively drought-tolerant once established, but they produce better fruit with regular watering. Water deeply once a week during dry periods.</p>

            <p><b>Pruning:</b>
            Timing: Prune in late winter or early spring to shape the tree and remove any dead or diseased branches. This encourages new growth and better air circulation.</p>

            <p><b>Mulching:</b>
            Technique: Apply a thick layer of mulch around the base of the tree to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.</p>

            <p><b>Pest and Disease Management:</b>
            Routine: Guavas are generally hardy but may be susceptible to pests like fruit flies, aphids, and scale. Use organic insecticides or neem oil to manage infestations. Keep an eye out for common diseases such as anthracnose and treat with appropriate fungicides.</p>

            <p><b>Harvesting Guavas:</b>
            Year 2+: Harvest Time</p>

            <p><b>Readiness:</b>
            Signs: Guavas are ready to harvest when they change color from green to yellow or pink, depending on the variety. The fruit should be slightly soft to the touch.</p>

            <p><b>Technique:</b>
            Method: Gently twist or cut the fruit from the tree to avoid damaging the branches. Guavas can ripen off the tree, so you can pick them when they are slightly under-ripe.</p>

            <p><b>Post-Harvest:</b>
            Storing: Store harvested guavas in a cool, dry place. They can be kept at room temperature for a few days or refrigerated to extend their freshness. Guavas can also be frozen, canned, or made into jams and jellies.</p>

            <p><b>Planning for Next Season:</b>
            Care: After harvesting, continue regular care with watering and fertilization. Prune after harvest to encourage healthy growth and fruit production in the next season.</p>
