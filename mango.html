            <h3>Mangoes<span>Fruit Cultivation</span></h3>

            <p><b>Introduction:</b>
            Mangoes are one of the most popular fruits globally, known for their sweet, tropical flavor and vibrant color. They are a rich source of vitamins, particularly vitamin C and vitamin A, and are used in a variety of dishes, from fresh salads to juices and desserts.</p>

            <p><b>Choosing the Planting Site:</b>
            Day 1-7: Site and Soil Preparation</p>

            <p><b>Light Requirements:</b>
            Sunlight: Mango trees require full sun, needing at least 8-10 hours of direct sunlight daily to ensure healthy growth and fruit production.</p>

            <p><b>Soil Type:</b>
            pH Level: Mango trees thrive in slightly acidic to neutral soils with a pH of 5.5-7.5.
            Amendments: They prefer well-drained, loamy soils rich in organic matter. Adding compost or well-rotted manure before planting can improve soil fertility and water retention.</p>

            <p><b>Planting:</b>
            Day 8-14: Planting Mango Saplings</p>

            <p><b>Ideal Timing:</b>
            Season: Plant mangoes in the late spring or early summer when temperatures are warm, and the soil is consistently warm, which helps in root establishment and growth.</p>

            <p><b>Planting Technique:</b>
            Depth: Plant the mango sapling at the same depth it was growing in the nursery. Space trees 25-30 feet apart to allow for their large canopy and root systems to develop properly.</p>

            <p><b>Watering:</b>
            After Planting: Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil around the roots. Young mango trees require regular watering, especially in dry periods, but mature trees are quite drought-tolerant.</p>

            <p><b>Care During Growth:</b>
            Week 2-12: Nurturing the Mango Trees</p>

            <p><b>Feeding:</b>
            Fertilization: Apply a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10) every 6-8 weeks during the growing season to support vigorous growth and fruit development. Reduce feeding in the fall to prepare the tree for dormancy.</p>

            <p><b>Mulching:</b>
            Technique: Apply a thick layer of organic mulch around the base of the tree, keeping it away from the trunk. This helps retain moisture, suppress weeds, and improve soil health.</p>

            <p><b>Pest and Disease Management:</b>
            Routine: Watch for common pests like aphids, mealybugs, and fruit flies. Use organic insecticides or natural predators to manage infestations. Regular pruning and ensuring good air circulation can prevent fungal diseases such as anthracnose.</p>

            <p><b>Harvesting:</b>
            Timing: Mangoes are ready to harvest when their color changes and they emit a fruity aroma. The fruit should be firm but give slightly when gently squeezed. Use a sharp knife or pruning shears to cut the fruit with a short stem attached.</p>

            <p><b>Pruning:</b>
            Care: Prune young trees to establish a strong framework and mature trees to remove dead or diseased branches and maintain shape. This also helps improve sunlight penetration and air circulation.</p>

            <p><b>Watering:</b>
            Routine: Continue to water regularly, especially during flowering and fruit development stages. Deep watering encourages deep root growth and reduces the risk of shallow roots that can harm the tree.</p>

            <p><b>Seasonal Transition:</b>
            Winter Care</p>

            <p><b>Preparing for Winter:</b>
            Technique: In areas prone to frost, protect young trees by covering them with frost cloth or blankets during cold snaps. Mature trees are more frost-tolerant but may need protection during unusually cold weather.</p>

            <p><b>Overwintering:</b>
            Method: In frost-free regions, mango trees can continue growing year-round. In colder areas, they enter a dormancy period and should be watered less frequently during this time.</p>

            <p><b>Planning for Next Season:</b>
            Technique: In spring, apply a balanced fertilizer to support new growth and prepare for the next fruiting season. Regularly check for pests and diseases as the weather warms up.</p>
